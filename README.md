# cs50finalproject: murdermystery

A Murder Mystery app where users can sign up, create a team, invite friends and use the app to play the game live.

The final project for my CS50 course:

The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. You may implement your project in any language(s). 

I choose a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, and SQL, based in part on the web track’s distribution code.
