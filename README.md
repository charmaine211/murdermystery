###*A murder mystery game webapp*

This webapp replaces the printout murder mystery games. I love playing boardgames with friends and recently tried a murder mystery game. The problem with the printout games is that there is a lot of preperation you have to do as a host. And it is not so easy to not spoil the game for yourself.
Also, with all the papers it becomes confusing. And takes you out of the game too much.

With this application the only preperation you have to do is pick a game, put a team together and read the rules. Everyone can open the application on their phone, without the need to download it. You do need to have an account to play the game.

**How the app works**

When opening the game, the games that you can play on the application.
You need to login to actually play the game, if you don't have an account you need to register.

When logged in you can see a list of the teams you're part of.

The game has 4 stages:

1. Pick a game and create a new team by inviting your friends
2. As a host you can choose a character for every player
3. Prepare by reading the rules of the game
4. Play the game

**With what languages did I create the game?**

- Python/Flask
- Jinja
- HTML
- CSS/Bootstrap
- Javascript
- SQLite

**What do I want to do in the future, to improve the app**

- Make the game a little bit more foolproof by adding bitesized instructions during the game. But it is important that people are not too dependent on the app. The game is supposed to be played live with a group of friends. And it is great if people don't have to be on their phone/computer all the time.
- Make the characters genderless
- Allow users to take notes and store it in the app
- Allow users to make accusations in the app
